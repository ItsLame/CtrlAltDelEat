## Setup

Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

On unix systems (linux/mac) run this in the root directory: `docker compose up`

Windows is not officially supported, assuming docker is installed it might work by running `docker compose up` from
powershell. Alternatively, the `Windows Subsystem for Linux` will work with the above commands.
